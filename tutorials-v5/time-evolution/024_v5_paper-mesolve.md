# QuTiPv5 Paper Example: `sesolve` and `mesolve` and the new solver class

Authors: Maximilian Meyer-Mölleringhof (m.meyermoelleringhof@gmail.com), Neill Lambert (nwlambert@gmail.com), Paul Menczel (paul@menczel.net)

In QuTiP, the `Qobj` and `QobjEvo` classes form the very heart of almost all calculations that can be performed.
With these classes, open quantum systems with various interactions and structures can be simulated by using the wide variety of solvers provided.
Most of the time, these solvers are given an initial state, a Hamiltonian and an environment that is often described using rates or coupling strengths.
QuTiP then uses numerical integration to determine the time evolution of the system.

QuTiP v5 [\[1\]](#references) introduces a unified interface for interacting with these solvers.
This new interface is class-based, allowing users to instantiate a solver object for a specific problem.
This can be useful when the same Hamiltonian data is reused with different initial conditions, time steps or other options.
A noticable speed-up can thus be achieved if solvers are reused multiple times.

Upon instantiation, one first supplies only the Hamiltonian and the collapse operators (e.g., collapse operators for a Lindbladian master equation).
Initial conditions, time steps, etc. are passed to the `Solver.run()` method which then performs the simulation.

In this notebook we will consider several examples illustrating the usage of the new solver classes.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from qutip import (
    QobjEvo,
    SESolver,
    UnderDampedEnvironment,
    about,
    basis,
    brmesolve,
    fidelity,
    mesolve,
    qeye,
    sigmam,
    sigmax,
    sigmaz,
    spost,
    spre,
    sprepost,
)
from qutip.solver.heom import HEOMSolver

%matplotlib inline
```

## Part 0: Introduction to the New Solver Class

In our first example, we want to look at two interacting qubits that are (for now) decoupled from an environment.
Such a system is described by the Hamiltonian

$$H = \dfrac{\epsilon_1}{2} \sigma_z^{(1)} + \dfrac{\epsilon_2}{2} \sigma_z^{(2)} + g \sigma_{x}^{(1)} \sigma_{x}^{(2)}.$$

The Pauli matrices $\sigma_z^{(1/2)}$ describe the respective two-level system of the qubits.
The qubits are coupled via $\sigma_{x}^{(1/2)}$ and their interaction strength is given by $g$.

```python
epsilon1 = 1.0
epsilon2 = 1.0
g = 0.1

sx1 = sigmax() & qeye(2)
sx2 = qeye(2) & sigmax()
sz1 = sigmaz() & qeye(2)
sz2 = qeye(2) & sigmaz()

H = (epsilon1 / 2) * sz1 + (epsilon2 / 2) * sz2 + g * sx1 * sx2

print(H)
```

The dynamics of such a system is described by the Schrödinger equation

$$i \hbar \dfrac{d}{dt} \ket{\psi} = H \ket{\psi}.$$

Therefore, we can use `SESolver` to calculate the dynamics.

```python
se_solver = SESolver(H)
psi0 = basis(2, 0) & basis(2, 1)
tlist = np.linspace(0, 40, 100)
```

```python
se_res = se_solver.run(psi0, tlist, e_ops=[sz1, sz2])
```

```python
plt.plot(tlist, se_res.expect[0], label="i=1")
plt.plot(tlist, se_res.expect[1], label="i=2")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel(r"$\langle \sigma_z^{(i)} \rangle$")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Solver and Integrator Options

Another change in QuTiP v5 is that the `options` argument takes a standard Python dictionary.
This should increase future flexibility and allow different solvers to provide individual sets of options more easily.
The complete list of options can be found in the online documentation for each solver.

As an example of frequently used options, we show `store_states`, determining whether the output should include the system state at each time step, and `store_final_state`, determining the same but for the final state.
`method` is another common option, specifying the ODE integration method.
Specific options related to the numeric integration depend on the chosen method; here, we show `atol` controlling the precision (absolute tolerance),
`nsteps` controlling the maximum number of steps between two time steps, and `max_step` giving the maximum allowed integration step of the default Adams ODE integration method.

```python
options = {"store_states": True, "atol": 1e-12, "nsteps": 1e3, "max_step": 0.1}
se_solver.options = options
```

```python
se_res = se_solver.run(psi0, tlist)
```

```python
print(se_res)
```

## Part 1: Lindblad Dynamics and Beyond

In general, the Schrödinger equation describes the dynamics of any quantum system.
Once systems become large or we consider continuous systems, however, solving it often becomes impossible.
Therefore, master equations of various types were developed and have now become the most common way to describe the dynamics of finite (open) quantum systems.
Generally, a master equation refers to a first-order linear differential equation for $\rho(t)$ which is the reduced density operator describing the quantum state.
In QuTiP, `mesolve` is the general solver we use to solve such master equations.
Although it supports master equations of various forms, the Lindbladian type is implemented by default.
The general form of such an equation is given by

$$ \dot{\rho}(t) = - \dfrac{i}{\hbar} [H(t), \rho(t)] + \sum_n \dfrac{1}{2}[ 2 C_n \rho(t) C_n^\dagger - \rho(t) C_n^\dagger C_n - C^\dagger_n C_n \rho(t) ] . $$

Next to the density operator $\rho(t)$ and the Hamiltonian $H(t)$, this equation includes the so-called collapse (or jump) operators $C_n = \sqrt{\gamma_n} A_n$.
They define the dissipation due to contact with an environment.
The rates $\gamma_n$ describe the frequency of transitions between the states connected by the operator $A_n$.

To continue our example of the two qubits, we now connect them to an evironment using the collapse operators $C_1 = \sqrt{\gamma} \sigma_{-}^{(1)}$ and $C_2 = \sqrt{\gamma} \sigma_{-}^{(2)}$ where $\sigma_{-}^{(i)}$ takes qubit (i) from its excited state to its ground state.
This time, however, we will be using the `mesolve` solver.

```python
sm1 = sigmam() & qeye(2)
sm2 = qeye(2) & sigmam()
gam = 0.1  # dissipation rate
c_ops = [np.sqrt(gam) * sm1, np.sqrt(gam) * sm2]
```

```python
me_local_res = mesolve(H, psi0, tlist, c_ops, e_ops=[sz1, sz2])
```

```python
plt.plot(tlist, me_local_res.expect[0], label="i=1")
plt.plot(tlist, me_local_res.expect[1], label="i=2")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel(r"$\langle \sigma_z^{(i)} \rangle$")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Global Master Equation - Born-Markov-secular approximation

In the previous example, the collapse operators acted *locally* on each qubit.
However, depending on the considered approximation, different kinds of collapse operators are found.
One example for this is when the qubits interact more strongly with each other than with the bath.
One then arrives at the *global* master equation under the standard Born-Markox approximation.
Although the collapse operators still act like annihilation and creation operators here, they now act on the total coupled eigenstates of the interacting two-qubit system

$$A_{ij} = \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i}$$

with rates

$$\gamma_{ij} = | \bra{\psi_i} d \ket{\psi_j} |^2 S(\Delta_{ij}).$$

The $\ket{\psi_i}$ are the eigenstates of $H$ and $\Delta_{ij} = E_j - E_i$ are the differences of eigenenergies.
$d$ is the coupling operator of the system to the environment.
We use the power spectrum

$$S(\omega) = 2 J(\omega) [n_{th} (\omega) + 1] \theta(\omega) + 2J(-\omega)[n_{th}(-\omega)]\theta(-\omega)$$

which depends on details of the environment such as its spectral density $J(\omega)$ and, through the Bose-Einstein distribution $n_{th} (\omega)$, its temperature.
$\theta$ denotes the Heaviside function.

By assuming spectral density to be flat, $J(\omega) = \gamma / 2$, and considering zero temperature, we can write

$$S(\omega) = \gamma \theta(\omega).$$

For this example, we manually implement this zero temperature environment for our two-qubit system using `mesolve()`.

```python
def power_spectrum(w):
    if w >= 0:
        return gam
    else:
        return 0


def make_co_list(energies, eigenstates):
    Nmax = len(eigenstates)
    collapse_list = []
    for i in range(Nmax):
        for j in range(Nmax):
            delE = energies[j] - energies[i]
            m1 = sx1.matrix_element(eigenstates[i].dag(), eigenstates[j])
            m2 = sx2.matrix_element(eigenstates[i].dag(), eigenstates[j])
            absolute = np.abs(m1) ** 2 + np.abs(m2) ** 2
            rate = power_spectrum(delE) * absolute
            if rate > 0:
                outer = eigenstates[i] * eigenstates[j].dag()
                collapse_list.append(np.sqrt(rate) * outer)
    return collapse_list
```

```python
all_energy, all_state = H.eigenstates()
collapse_list = make_co_list(all_energy, all_state)
tlist_long = np.linspace(0, 1000, 100)
```

```python
opt = {"store_states": True}
me_global_res = mesolve(
    H, psi0, tlist_long, collapse_list, e_ops=[sz1, sz2], options=opt
)
```

It is interesting to note that the long-time evolution leads to a state that is close to the coupled ground state of the two qubit system:

```python
grnd_state = all_state[0] @ all_state[0].dag()
fidelity = fidelity(me_global_res.states[-1], grnd_state)
print(f"Fidelity with ground-state: {fidelity:.6f}")
```

### Solver comparison

In the following, we compare the results of the local and dressed (global) Lindblad simulations from above with the Bloch-Redfield solver.
The Bloch-Redfield solver is explained in more detail in other tutorials, but we use it here to solve the weak-coupling master equation from a given bath power spectrum.
For small coupling strengths, the results from the local and global master equations both agree with the Bloch-Redfield solver.
However, this changes when considering stronger couplings where the local master equation deviates from the result of the global and the Bloch-Redfield approach.

```python
# weak coupling
g = 0.1 * epsilon1
H_weak = (epsilon1 / 2) * sz1 + (epsilon2 / 2) * sz2 + g * sx1 * sx2
```

```python
# generate new collapse operators for weak coupling Hamiltonian
all_energy, all_state = H_weak.eigenstates()
co_list = make_co_list(all_energy, all_state)
```

```python
me_local_res = mesolve(H_weak, psi0, tlist, c_ops, e_ops=[sz1, sz2])
me_global_res = mesolve(H_weak, psi0, tlist, co_list, e_ops=[sz1, sz2])
br_res = brmesolve(
    H_weak,
    psi0,
    tlist,
    e_ops=[sz1, sz2],
    a_ops=[[sx1, power_spectrum], [sx2, power_spectrum]],
)
```

```python
plt.plot(tlist, me_local_res.expect[0], label=r"Local Lindblad")
plt.plot(tlist, me_global_res.expect[0], "--", label=r"Dressed Lindblad")
plt.plot(tlist, br_res.expect[0], ":", label=r"Bloch-Redfield")
plt.title("Weak Coupling")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel(r"$\langle \sigma_z^{(1)} \rangle$")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

```python
# strong coupling
g = 2 * epsilon1
H_strong = (epsilon1 / 2) * sz1 + (epsilon2 / 2) * sz2 + g * sx1 * sx2
```

```python
# generate new collapse operators for weak coupling Hamiltonian
all_energy, all_state = H_strong.eigenstates()
co_list = make_co_list(all_energy, all_state)

# time list with smaller steps
tlist_fine = np.linspace(0, 40, 1000)
```

```python
me_local_res = mesolve(H_strong, psi0, tlist_fine, c_ops, e_ops=[sz1, sz2])
me_global_res = mesolve(H_strong, psi0, tlist_fine, co_list, e_ops=[sz1, sz2])
br_res = brmesolve(
    H_strong,
    psi0,
    tlist_fine,
    e_ops=[sz1, sz2],
    a_ops=[[sx1, power_spectrum], [sx2, power_spectrum]],
)
```

```python
plt.plot(tlist_fine, me_local_res.expect[0], label=r"Local Lindblad")
plt.plot(tlist_fine, me_global_res.expect[0], "--", label=r"Dressed Lindblad")
plt.plot(tlist_fine, br_res.expect[0], ":", label=r"Bloch-Redfield")
plt.title("Strong Coupling")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel(r"$\langle \sigma_z^{(1)} \rangle$")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Manual Liouvillian Superoperator

As mentioned before, QuTiP's master equation solver can be used to solve any other master equation.
By using `spre()`, `spost()` and `sprepost()`, we can manually construct such equations.
These functions specifically convert the operators from the original Hilbert space to operators in the double space which is internally used by QuTiP to optimize computations (more details on this can be found in the [QuTiPv5 paper](#References)).

For example, the Lindbladian corresponding to the master equation of the previous example can be constructed manually via:


```python
lindbladian = -1.0j * (spre(H) - spost(H))
for c in c_ops:
    lindbladian += sprepost(c, c.dag())
    lindbladian -= 0.5 * (spre(c.dag() * c) + spost(c.dag() * c))
```

```python
manual_res = mesolve(lindbladian, psi0, tlist_fine, [], e_ops=[sz1, sz2])
```

```python
plt.plot(tlist_fine, me_local_res.expect[0], label="i=1")
plt.plot(tlist_fine, me_local_res.expect[1], label="i=2")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel(r"$\langle \sigma_z^{(i)} \rangle$")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Part 2: Time-Dependent Systems

Finally, we compare the results from another example, that of a driven system using, first, `mesolve()` with and without the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) for the drive, and then without RWA with the Bloch-Redfield and HEOM solvers.
For this, we consider a Hamiltonian of the form

$$ H = \frac{\Delta}{2} \sigma_z + \frac{A}{2} \sin (\omega_d t) \sigma_x , $$

where $\Delta$ is the energy splitting, $A$ is the drive amplitude and $\omega_d$ is the drive's frequency.

```python
# Hamiltonian parameters
Delta = 2 * np.pi  # qubit splitting
omega_d = Delta  # drive frequency
A = 0.01 * Delta  # drive amplitude

# Bath parameters
gamma = 0.005 * Delta / (2 * np.pi)  # dissipation strength
temp = 0  # temperature

# Simulation parameters
psi0 = basis(2, 0)  # initial state
e_ops = [sigmaz()]
T = 2 * np.pi / omega_d  # period length
tlist = np.linspace(0, 1000 * T, 500)
```

### With `mesolve`

```python
# driving field
def f(t):
    return np.sin(omega_d * t)
```

```python
H0 = Delta / 2.0 * sigmaz()
H1 = [A / 2.0 * sigmax(), f]
H = [H0, H1]
```

```python
c_ops_me = [np.sqrt(gamma) * sigmam()]
```

```python
driv_res = mesolve(H, psi0, tlist, c_ops=c_ops_me, e_ops=e_ops)
```

### With Rotating-Wave-Approximated `mesolve`

```python
H_RWA = (Delta - omega_d) * 0.5 * sigmaz() + A / 4 * sigmax()
c_ops_me_RWA = [np.sqrt(gamma) * sigmam()]
```

```python
driv_RWA_res = mesolve(H_RWA, psi0, tlist, c_ops=c_ops_me_RWA, e_ops=e_ops)
```

### With `brmesolve`

```python
# Bose einstein distribution
def nth(w):
    if temp > 0:
        return 1 / (np.exp(w / temp) - 1)
    else:
        return 0


# Power spectrum
def power_spectrum(w):
    if w > 0:
        return gamma * (nth(w) + 1)
    elif w == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return gamma * nth(-w)
```

```python
a_ops = [[sigmax(), power_spectrum]]
```

```python
driv_br_res = brmesolve(H, psi0, tlist, a_ops, sec_cutoff=-1, e_ops=e_ops)
```

### With `HEOMSolver`

```python
max_depth = 4  # number of hierarchy levels

wsamp = 2 * np.pi
w0 = 5 * 2 * np.pi
gamma_heom = 1.9 * w0

lambd = np.sqrt(
    0.5
    * gamma
    * ((w0**2 - wsamp**2) ** 2 + (gamma_heom**2) * ((wsamp) ** 2))
    / (gamma_heom * wsamp)
)
```

```python
# Create Environment
bath = UnderDampedEnvironment(lam=lambd, w0=w0, gamma=gamma_heom, T=0)
fit_times = np.linspace(0, 5, 1000)  # range for correlation function fit

# Fit correlation function with exponentials
exp_bath, fit_info = bath.approx_by_cf_fit(
    fit_times, Ni_max=1, Nr_max=2, target_rmse=None
)
print(fit_info["summary"])
```

```python
HEOM_corr_fit = HEOMSolver(
    QobjEvo(H),
    (exp_bath, sigmax()),
    max_depth=max_depth,
    options={"nsteps": 15000, "rtol": 1e-12, "atol": 1e-12},
)
results_corr_fit = HEOM_corr_fit.run(psi0 * psi0.dag(), tlist, e_ops=e_ops)
```

### Comparison of Solver Results

```python
plt.figure()

plt.plot(tlist, driv_res.expect[0], "-", label="mesolve (time-dep)")
plt.plot(tlist, driv_RWA_res.expect[0], "-.", label="mesolve (rwa)")
plt.plot(tlist, np.real(results_corr_fit.expect[0]), "--", label=r"heomsolve")
plt.plot(tlist, driv_br_res.expect[0], ":", linewidth=3, label="brmesolve")

plt.xlabel(r"$t\, /\, \Delta^{-1}$")
plt.ylabel(r"$\langle \sigma_z \rangle$")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Adiabatic Energy Switching

To show where usage of these local-basis collapse operators can lead to errors, we look at a single qubit system.
This time however, the energies of the qubit are adiabatically switched between positive and negative values.

$$H = \dfrac{\Delta}{2} \sin{(\omega_d t)} \sigma_z.$$

If the drive is slow enough, we expect the bath to respond to this change and transitions from higher to lower energy levels should be induced.
These changes in system energy thus have to be taken into account so that `mesolve()` still produces a correct result.

```python
# Hamiltonian
omega_d = 0.05 * Delta  # drive frequency
A = Delta  # drive amplitude
H_adi = [[A / 2.0 * sigmaz(), f]]

# Bath parameters
gamma = 0.05 * Delta / (2 * np.pi)

# Simulation parameters
T = 2 * np.pi / omega_d  # period length
tlist = np.linspace(0, 2 * T, 400)
```

```python
# Simple mesolve
c_ops_me = [np.sqrt(gamma) * sigmam()]
adi_me_res = mesolve(H_adi, psi0, tlist, c_ops=c_ops_me, e_ops=e_ops)
```

```python
# HEOM
max_depth = 4  # number of hierarchy levels

wsamp = 2 * np.pi
w0 = 5 * 2 * np.pi
gamma_heom = 1.9 * w0

lambd = np.sqrt(
    0.5
    * gamma
    / (gamma_heom * wsamp)
    * ((w0**2 - wsamp**2) ** 2 + (gamma_heom**2) * ((wsamp) ** 2))
)
```

```python
# Create Environment
bath = UnderDampedEnvironment(lam=lambd, w0=w0, gamma=gamma_heom, T=0)
fit_times = np.linspace(0, 5, 1000)  # range for correlation function fit

# Fit correlation function with exponentials
exp_bath, fit_info = bath.approx_by_cf_fit(
    fit_times, Ni_max=1, Nr_max=2, target_rmse=None
)
print(fit_info["summary"])
```

```python
HEOM_corr_fit = HEOMSolver(
    QobjEvo(H_adi),
    (exp_bath, sigmax()),
    max_depth=max_depth,
    options={"nsteps": 15000, "rtol": 1e-12, "atol": 1e-12},
)
adi_corr_fit_res = HEOM_corr_fit.run(psi0 * psi0.dag(), tlist, e_ops=e_ops)
```

```python
# BRSolve non-flat power spectrum
a_ops_non_flat = [[sigmax(), exp_bath]]
brme_result = brmesolve(H_adi, psi0, tlist, a_ops=a_ops_non_flat, e_ops=e_ops)
```

```python
# BRSolve
a_ops = [[sigmax(), power_spectrum]]
brme_result2 = brmesolve(H_adi, psi0, tlist, a_ops=a_ops, e_ops=e_ops)
```

```python
